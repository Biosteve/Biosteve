- 👋 Hi, I’m @Biosteve
- 👀 I’m interested in Data science and machine learning.
-    I am a PhD holder in Biology, but i was always interested in Data science and machine learning so that i can combine them with my PhD knowledge/skills.
- 🌱 Currently I am studying at the MSc course "Applied Bioinformatics and Data Analysis" at Democritus University of Thrace.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use Data analysis and machine learning on problems with biological applications
- 📫 How to reach me. When i learn more things about GitHub i will update this section!!
